# Uncommon Expo CLI Bugs and Debugging Strategies

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI and provides strategies for resolving them.  These bugs often lack clear error messages and require a systematic approach to identify and fix the root causes.

**Common Scenarios:**
* Unexpected build failures with minimal error information.
* Dependency conflicts resulting in unpredictable behavior.
* Issues with Expo plugins leading to subtle runtime errors.
* Configuration errors in `app.json` or `package.json` files.
* Caching issues requiring cache clearing.
* Environment inconsistencies between local development and build server.

**Debugging Techniques:**
* Carefully review Expo documentation for troubleshooting steps.
* Check package versions for compatibility.
* Examine `app.json` and `package.json` for any configuration errors.
* Use dependency tree analysis tools to identify conflicts.
* Clear the Expo cache using `expo start --clear`. 
* Test your app in different environments to identify inconsistencies.
* Consult the Expo community forums and issue trackers for similar problems and potential solutions.
