The solutions to these uncommon Expo CLI bugs are highly context-dependent. However, a systematic debugging approach usually involves:

1. **Reproduce the issue consistently:**  Try to isolate the problem by creating a minimal reproducible example.  Start by removing non-essential packages to determine if they contribute to the issue. 
2. **Examine build logs:**  Pay close attention to the complete output from Expo's build process. There might be subtle clues even in warnings or seemingly unrelated messages.   
3. **Check package versions:** Update to the latest versions of Expo, React Native, and your other dependencies. Also verify package compatibilities. 
4. **Dependency Conflict Resolution:** Employ tools such as `npm ls` or `yarn why` to inspect the dependency tree and look for inconsistencies. Using npm's `dedupe` or yarn's resolution strategies may help solve dependency version conflicts. 
5. **Inspect `app.json` and `package.json`:** Carefully review your configuration files for typos, missing fields, or inconsistencies in settings related to plugins, assets, and other project components. 
6. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Try cleaning the project's cache (`expo start --clear`), removing the `node_modules` directory, and reinstalling all dependencies.  
7. **Simplify your code:** Gradually reduce your project's complexity, disabling features or removing parts until the error disappears. This helps isolate the problematic component. 
8. **Community Support:** Search online forums, the Expo documentation, and GitHub issues for similar problems.  Consider posting your problem along with the minimal reproducible example to increase the chances of finding assistance. 
9. **Create a Minimal Reproducible Example (MRE):** Isolate the problem into the smallest possible codebase. This helps pinpoint the core issue and makes it easier for others to assist. 

Remember to systematically work through these steps, keeping careful track of your changes to facilitate debugging.
